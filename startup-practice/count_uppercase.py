"""

In the Code tab is a function which is meant to return how many uppercase letters there are in a list of various words. Fix the list comprehension so that the code functions normally!

Examples
count_uppercase(["SOLO", "hello", "Tea", "wHat"]) ➞ 6

count_uppercase(["little", "lower", "down"]) ➞ 0

count_uppercase(["EDAbit", "Educate", "Coding"]) ➞ 5
Notes
Check the Resources for some helpful tutorials on list comprehensions.
